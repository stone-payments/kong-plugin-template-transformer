# Contributor Guidelines

:honeybee: Please read this document before beginning any implementation, we use a set of guidelines that should be followed.:honeybee:

## DOs and DON'Ts

- **DO** follow our git branching styleguide
- **DO** give priority to the current style of the project or file you&#39;re changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines
- **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken
- **DO** keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it&#39;s often better to create a new issue than to side track the discussion
- **DO NOT** make PRs for style changes
- **DO NOT** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time working on it
- **DO NOT** add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first

### Adding External Library Dependencies

- Add new dependencies to the project ONLY IF STRICTLY NECESSARY, we know that adding new dependencies is easier, but by doing so it increases the build time of the framework.

### Workflow

- We use GitFlow, you can find more about this workfow [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### Branching
-  **New Features** `feature/<Name of feature>` from `develop`.
-  **Bugfix** `bugfix/<Name of bugfix>` from `develop`.
-  **Improvements** `improvement/<Name of improvement>` from `develop`.
-  **Hotfix** `bugfix/<Name of hotfix>` from `master`.

### Tests and coverage

- Don't forget to write tests!!
- We'd like to keep our project with a minimum of 60%, but 90% is the desirable target.

### Commit messages 

- Use emoji at the beginning of each message. It help us to identify what's the purpose for each commit.

Commit exemple:
```
git commit -m ":arrow_up: Updates rockspec"
```

### Pull Requests

- **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. &quot;Improves code coverage for System.Console by 10%&quot;, not &quot;Fix #1234&quot;).
- **DO NOT** submit &quot;work in progress&quot; PRs. A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.
- **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
- **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
- **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds. The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it&#39;ll be merged.
- **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.
- **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary. This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes. If necessary, squashing should be handled by the merger using the &quot;squash and merge&quot; feature, and should only be done by the contributor upon request.
- **DO** all the PRs to `develop` branch unless it is a `hotfix`

### Guiding Principles

- We allow anyone to participate in our projects. Tasks can be carried out by anyone that demonstrates the capability to complete them.
- Always be respectful of one another. Assume the best in others and act with empathy at all times.
- Collaborate closely with individuals maintaining the project or experienced users. Getting ideas out in the open and seeing a proposal before it's a pull request helps reduce redundancy and ensures we're all connected to the decision making process.
- Don't be a jerk.
